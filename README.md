# X-Label

Draws info about AI aircraft on the screen (on top of everything else).

The box shows the AI aircraft number, the distance in kilometers, or in meters if less than 5 kms, and the altitude difference with your aircraft. The last symbol shows the vertical speed direction of the target plane.

Can display distance to points of interest in a similar manner. This slows down X-plane a lot.

Possibility to warp the user aircraft to the first AI aircraft, copying position, speed and orientation.
